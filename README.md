For the first assignment, I chose to use the palmerpenguins data package (https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/). The package contains the 'penguins' dataset which contains size measurements for various parameters from three different penguin species located in three different islands. For the first assignment, I want to compare the mean body mass for each penguin species and the corresponding island that they are located in, along with the corresponding standard errror.
