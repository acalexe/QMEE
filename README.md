For the first assignment, I chose to use the palmerpenguins data package (https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/). The package contains the 'penguins' dataset which contains size measurements for various parameters from three different penguin species located in three different islands. For the first assignment, I want to compare the mean body mass for each penguin species based o  the corresponding island that they are located in, along with the corresponding standard error. A second purpose of this calculation is to determine if the mean weight of a penguin species that is found on multiple islands differs based on the location. To calculate this, I grouped the penguins based on their corresponding species and based on the island they occupy.
