For assignment four I chose the following article:

Noh, Jihyun, Rebecca P. Seal, Jessica A. Garver, Robert H. Edwards, and Karl Kandler. "Glutamate co-release at GABA/glycinergic synapses is crucial for the refinement of an inhibitory map." Nature neuroscience 13, no. 2 (2010): 232-238.

Significance: the paper by Noh et al. investigates the role of VGLUT3 expression for the developmental refinement of an immature inhibitory projection in the developing auditory brainstem. VGLUT3 is necessary for the packaging of glutamate into synaptic vesicles, and the authors found that in knockout mice that lack VGLUT3 expression, the inhibitory projection does not undergo developmental strenghtening (increased input strength of synaptic responses) and fails to undergo developmental elimination of synaptic inputs (a necessary component for auditory frequency inputs fine-tuning). 

Statistical philosophy: although I could not find any major statistical errors, given my limited understanding of statistical tests, there were many instances throughout the paper where the authors could have improved their presentation of statistical tests. Many experiments in the paper were based on relatively small sample sizes (n < 10) and a recurring instance for this paper was the lack of effect size numbers, description of normality tests used, and instances where authors did not specify what statistical test was used.

Figure 2: the experiments for figure 2 investigate the strengthening of single fibre inputs in wildtype and VGLUT3 knockout mice during the first two postnatal weeks (postnatal day P1-2 and P9-12), a time period where individual fibres greatly increase their input strength. 
  The authors mention in the results section: "In newborn mice (P1–2), we found no difference in the amplitude of single-fiber responses between Vglut3+/+ and Vglut3−/− mice (P > 0.3, Student’s t test; Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1), indicating that the initial formation of MNTB-LSO connections occurs independent of glutamate co-release." The authors also write in the figure 2 caption "(c) Population data. At P1–2, single-fiber responses (mean of averaged response per cells) were not significantly different between Vglut3+/+ (71 ± 9 pA, n = 12 cells) and Vglut3−/− mice (83 ± 10 pA, n = 16 cells; P > 0.3, Student’s t test).". 
    In such instances, the addition of effect size numbers (e.g., Cohen's d) would aid in the statistical philosophy for these results. Further, although the authors mention n values of 12 and 16, they fail to mention whether the n= 12 cells and n = 16 cells come from multiple wildtype and knockout mice or just from a single mouse. For this experiment, the authors mention in the paper that the data was tested for a normal distribution, but they do not mention which normality tests were used, nor do they state any normality values. As such, it is unclear whether the Student's t test was appropriate for these results.
  Based on table 1 from Dushoff, Kain, and Bolker (2019), a better way to interpret the findings would be to say: In newborn mice (P1-2), given our relatively small sample sizes, our data on the amplitude of single-fibre responses were statistically unclear for wildtype and VGLUT3 knockout mice.


Figure 4: the experiments in figure 4 investigate whether VGLUT3-mediated glutamate release is required for normal developmental refinement of the inhibitory inputs by meauring maximal input strength (total fibre count stimulation) along with synaptic input delay time constants for wildtype and VGLUT3 knockout mice. 
  In the results section, the authors write: "However, decay times in Vglut3−/− mice were longer than in Vglut3+/+ mice (Vglut3+/+, 45.2 ± 3.7 ms, n = 15; Vglut3−/−, 85.5 ± 5.1 ms, n = 17; P < 0.01)." 
      Although the authors used a Student's t test to look at the maximal response amplitudes, they do not mention if a Student's t test was also used for the time constants, making the statistical interpretation misleading. Furthermore, the authors did not provide an effect size or confidence intervals for the decay times. 
    In the figure 4 caption, the authors write "(c) Population data. At P1–2, the mean amplitude of maximal responses was not significantly different between Vglut3+/+ (1.3 ± 0.2 nA, n = 15) and Vglut3−/− mice (1.5 ± 0.2 nA, n = 17; P > 0.4). At P9–12, the mean amplitude of maximal responses was significantly larger in Vglut3+/+ mice (4.3 ± 0.5 nA, n = 36) than in Vglut3−/− mice (2.4 ± 0.2 nA, n = 44; *** P < 0.001, Student’s t test). Right, cumulative probability histograms for maximal responses at P1–2 and P9–12 in Vglut3+/+ and Vglut3−/− mice (P1–2, P > 0.5; P9–12, P < 0.002; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)." 
      Here, we know that the maximal input strength increases substantially with age, yet the authors fail to mention how many n values come from P9, P10, P11, and P12 data, along with mentioning if the n values represents cells from the same animal or from different animals. For these results, the n values at the P9-12 age are also roughly 3-fold higher than the n values for the P1-2 data, yet the authors do not include any effect size numbers to aid their statistical results. Without effect size for both age groups, we cannot be certain that the results are large, despite the small p-value. Here, the authors also describe statistical findings using parametric (Student's t test) and non-parametric (K-S test) for the same data without providing explanation as to why both tests were used and their underlying inferential questions. 
  A better way to interpret the findings would be to say: In VGLUT3 -/- mice, our data from individual mice suggest that decay time constants were longer compared to age-matched wildtype mice. Although our statistical test suggets that there may be a clear difference between the two groups, we cannot assess the magnitude of the difference without further analysis of the effect sizes and confidence intervals. For maximal input strength, although our data show statistical clarity between VGLUT3 -/- and wildtype mice at P9-12 based on Student's t test and K-S test, the magnitude of this difference is uncertain due to differences in the sample sizes between the P1-2 and P9-12 groups.

Figure 5: the experiments in figure 5 investigate the developmental refinement of inhibitory inputs by assessing age-dependent elimination of synaptic inputs, a process proposed to depend on VGLUT3-mediated glutamate release. The authors report no clear differences between wild-type and VGLUT3 knockout mice at P1–3, but a clear difference in the inhibitory projection input map size between the two groups at P9–12.
  In the results section, the authors write: "In newborn mice (P1–3), the fraction of the MNTB that contained neurons that were synaptically linked to individual LSO neurons (MNTB input area) was about 30% and was similar in Vglut3+/+ and Vglut3−/− mice (Vglut3+/+, 30.6 ± 3.3%, n = 6; Vglut3−/−, 34.6 ± 4.6%, n = 6; P > 0.5, Student’s t test; Fig. 5b). In Vglut3+/+ mice, the size of MNTB input areas decreased by 50% over the next 10 d (15.6 ± 1.5% at P9–12, n = 13), indicating an increase in the precision of the topographic map. In contrast, there was only a slight and statistically nonsignificant decrease in input area by 15% in Vglut3−/− mice (to 29.4 ± 1.6%, n = 15). Thus, input maps at hearing onset in Vglut3−/− mice were twice as large as inputs maps in Vglut3+/+ mice (P < 0.0001, Student’s t test)."
    As in previous results, there is a small n value for the P1-3 age group. The authors fail to mention which exact ages and animal / cell count were used in the data points. The authors do not mention any tests for equal variance between the groups nor any effect size calculations.
